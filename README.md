# Chess Engine - Player vs Player

## Overview
This is a simple, two-player chess engine built in Python. The game is designed for local play, allowing two players to compete against each other. It does not feature AI or any complex game logic beyond basic chess rules, so it is perfect for those who just want to play chess with a friend on the same computer.

## Features
